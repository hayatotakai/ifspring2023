                <p>Duke Ellington, (Edward Kennedy Ellington), (born April 29, 1899, Washington,
                    D.C., U.S.—died May 24, 1974, New York, N.Y.), American pianist who was
                    the greatest jazz composer and bandleader of his time. One of the originators
                    of big-band jazz, Ellington led his band for more than half a century, composed
                    thousands of scores, and created one of the most distinctive ensemble sounds
                    in all of Western music.</p>

            <h6 class="centered">Early Life</h6>
            <p>
            Ellington grew up in a secure middle-class family in Washington, D.C. His family encouraged his interests in the fine arts, and he began studying piano at age seven. He became engrossed in studying art during his high-school years, and he was awarded, but did not accept, a scholarship to the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York. Inspired by ragtime performers, he began to perform professionally at age 17.

            <h6 class="centered">Career</h6>
            <p>
            Ellington first played in New York City in 1923. Later that year he moved there and, in Broadway nightclubs, led a sextet that grew in time into a 10-piece ensemble. The singular blues-based melodies; the harsh, vocalized sounds of his trumpeter, Bubber Miley (who used a plunger [“wa-wa”] mute); and the sonorities of the distinctive trombonist Joe (“Tricky Sam”) Nanton (who played muted “growl” sounds) all influenced Ellington’s early “jungle style,” as seen in such masterpieces as “East St. Louis Toodle-oo” (1926) and “Black and Tan Fantasy” (1927).

            Extended residencies at the Cotton Club in Harlem (1927–32, 1937–38) stimulated Ellington to enlarge his band to 14 musicians and to expand his compositional scope. He selected his musicians for their expressive individuality, and several members of his ensemble—including trumpeter Cootie Williams (who replaced Miley), cornetist Rex Stewart, trombonist Lawrence Brown, baritone saxophonist Harry Carney, alto saxophonist Johnny Hodges, and clarinetist Barney Bigard—were themselves important jazz artists. (The most popular of these was Hodges, who rendered ballads with a full, creamy tone and long portamentos.) With these exceptional musicians, who remained with him throughout the 1930s, Ellington made hundreds of recordings, appeared in films and on radio, and toured Europe in 1933 and 1939.
            
            The expertise of this ensemble allowed Ellington to break away from the conventions of band-section scoring. Instead, he used new harmonies to blend his musicians’ individual sounds and emphasized congruent sections and a supple ensemble that featured Carney’s full bass-clef sound. He illuminated subtle moods with ingenious combinations of instruments; among the most famous examples is “Mood Indigo” in his 1930 setting for muted trumpet, unmuted trombone, and low-register clarinet. In 1931 Ellington began to create extended works, including such pieces as Creole Rhapsody, Reminiscing in Tempo, and Diminuendo in Blue/Crescendo in Blue. He composed a series of works to highlight the special talents of his soloists. Williams, for example, demonstrated his versatility in Ellington’s noted miniature concertos “Echoes of Harlem” and “Concerto for Cootie”. Some of Ellington’s numbers—notably “Caravan” and “Perdido” by trombonist Juan Tizol—were cowritten or entirely composed by sidemen. Few of Ellington’s soloists, despite their importance to jazz history, played as effectively in other contexts; no one else, it seemed, could match the inspiration that Ellington provided with his sensitive, masterful settings.

                        "Take the A Train" is a jazz standard composed by Billy Strayhorn, with lyrics added by Duke
                        Ellington. The song was first recorded by Ellington and his orchestra in 1941, and quickly
                        became one of his most popular and recognizable compositions.

                        The song's title refers to the A train, which was the subway line that ran from Brooklyn to
                        Harlem in New York City. The lyrics describe the route that the train takes, and encourage
                        listeners to "take the A train" to Harlem, where the music is lively and the atmosphere is
                        festive.

                        The song's melody is characterized by a swinging, uptempo rhythm and features a memorable
                        opening riff that has become one of the most recognizable in jazz music. The song also features
                        a series of solos by various members of the band, including Ellington himself on piano.

                        "Take the A Train" has been widely covered by jazz musicians and has become a beloved standard
                        in the genre. The song's enduring popularity can be attributed to its catchy melody, lively
                        rhythm, and the way it captures the spirit and energy of Harlem during the swing era. It is
                        considered one of Ellington's signature tunes and is a testament to his enduring influence on
                        jazz music.

                        "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" is a jazz standard composed by Duke
                        Ellington, with lyrics by Irving Mills. The song was first recorded by Ellington and his
                        orchestra in 1932, and has since become one of Ellington's most famous and enduring
                        compositions.

                        The song's title reflects its central theme, which is the importance of swing rhythm in jazz
                        music. The lyrics assert that music without swing is lacking in vitality and emotional impact.
                        The melody is characterized by a catchy, syncopated riff that serves as the song's main hook.
                        The song's lyrics are playful and clever, featuring puns and wordplay that add to its joyful,
                        exuberant tone.

                        "It Don't Mean a Thing" has been widely covered by jazz and pop musicians over the years, and
                        has been featured in numerous films and television shows. The song's enduring popularity can be
                        attributed to its infectious melody, witty lyrics, and the way it encapsulates the spirit of
                        swing-era jazz. It is widely regarded as a classic example of the genre and a defining moment in
                        Duke Ellington's illustrious career.

                        "I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart" is a classic jazz standard composed by Duke Ellington, with
                        lyrics by Irving Mills, Henry Nemo, and John Redmond. The song was first recorded by Duke

                        The song is a ballad that speaks of lost love, with the narrator lamenting the fact that he let
                        a beautiful melody slip away from him. The lyrics are poignant and introspective, with the
                        narrator reflecting on the pain of losing a loved one and the power of music to evoke memories
                        and emotions.

                        The melody is gentle and reflective, with a lush orchestration that is characteristic of
                        Ellington's style. The song features a soaring trumpet solo and a beautiful saxophone solo, both
                        of which showcase the virtuosity of Ellington's band.

                        "I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart" is a timeless classic that has been covered by numerous
                        artists over the years. Its enduring popularity is a testament to Ellington's genius as a
                        composer and bandleader, and his ability to capture the complexities of the human experience
                        through music.

                    <p>Numerous memorials have been dedicated to Duke Ellington
                        in cities from New York and Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles.
                        In Ellington's birthplace, Washington, D.C., the Duke Ellington
                        School of the Arts educates talented students who are
                        considering careers in the arts by providing art instruction and
                        academic programs to prepare students for post-secondary
                        education and professional careers. In 1974, the District
                        renamed the Calvert Street Bridge, originally built in 1935, as
                        the Duke Ellington Bridge. Another school is P.S. 004 Duke
                        Ellington in New York.

                    <p>In 1989, a bronze plaque was attached to the newly named
                        Duke Ellington Building at 2121 Ward Place NW. In
                        2012, the new owner of the building commissioned a mural
                        by Aniekan Udofia that appears above the lettering "Duke
                        Ellington". In 2010 the triangular park, across the street from
                        Duke Ellington's birth site, at the intersection of New Hampshire
                        and M Streets NW, was named the Duke Ellington Park.
                        Ellington's residence at 2728 Sherman Avenue NW, during the
                        years 1919–1922, is marked by a bronze plaque.
                        On February 24, 2009, the United States Mint issued a coin
                        with Duke Ellington on it, making him the first African
                        American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin.
                        Ellington appears on the reverse (tails) side of the District of
                        Columbia quarter.The coin is part of the U.S. Mint's
                        program honoring the District and the U.S. territories and
                        celebrates Ellington's birthplace in the District of Columbia.
                        Ellington is depicted on the quarter seated at a piano, sheet
                        music in hand, along with the inscription "Justice for All",
                        which is the District's motto.
                        In 1986, a United States commemorative stamp was issued
                        featuring Ellington's likeness.</p>
