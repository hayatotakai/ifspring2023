                <p>Duke Ellington, (Edward Kennedy Ellington), (born April 29, 1899, Washington,
                    D.C., U.S.—died May 24, 1974, New York, N.Y.), American pianist who was
                    the greatest jazz composer and bandleader of his time. One of the originators
                    of big-band jazz, Ellington led his band for more than half a century, composed
                    thousands of scores, and created one of the most distinctive ensemble sounds
                    in all of Western music.</p>

                        "Take the A Train" is a jazz standard composed by Billy Strayhorn, with lyrics added by Duke
                        Ellington. The song was first recorded by Ellington and his orchestra in 1941, and quickly
                        became one of his most popular and recognizable compositions.

                        The song's title refers to the A train, which was the subway line that ran from Brooklyn to
                        Harlem in New York City. The lyrics describe the route that the train takes, and encourage
                        listeners to "take the A train" to Harlem, where the music is lively and the atmosphere is
                        festive.

                        The song's melody is characterized by a swinging, uptempo rhythm and features a memorable
                        opening riff that has become one of the most recognizable in jazz music. The song also features
                        a series of solos by various members of the band, including Ellington himself on piano.

                        "Take the A Train" has been widely covered by jazz musicians and has become a beloved standard
                        in the genre. The song's enduring popularity can be attributed to its catchy melody, lively
                        rhythm, and the way it captures the spirit and energy of Harlem during the swing era. It is
                        considered one of Ellington's signature tunes and is a testament to his enduring influence on
                        jazz music.

                        "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" is a jazz standard composed by Duke
                        Ellington, with lyrics by Irving Mills. The song was first recorded by Ellington and his
                        orchestra in 1932, and has since become one of Ellington's most famous and enduring
                        compositions.

                        The song's title reflects its central theme, which is the importance of swing rhythm in jazz
                        music. The lyrics assert that music without swing is lacking in vitality and emotional impact.
                        The melody is characterized by a catchy, syncopated riff that serves as the song's main hook.
                        The song's lyrics are playful and clever, featuring puns and wordplay that add to its joyful,
                        exuberant tone.

                        "It Don't Mean a Thing" has been widely covered by jazz and pop musicians over the years, and
                        has been featured in numerous films and television shows. The song's enduring popularity can be
                        attributed to its infectious melody, witty lyrics, and the way it encapsulates the spirit of
                        swing-era jazz. It is widely regarded as a classic example of the genre and a defining moment in
                        Duke Ellington's illustrious career.

    <p>Numerous memorials have been dedicated to Duke Ellington 
        in cities from New York and Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles.
        In Ellington's birthplace, Washington, D.C., the Duke Ellington 
        School of the Arts educates talented students who are 
        considering careers in the arts by providing art instruction and 
        academic programs to prepare students for post-secondary 
        education and professional careers. In 1974, the District 
        renamed the Calvert Street Bridge, originally built in 1935, as 
        the Duke Ellington Bridge. Another school is P.S. 004 Duke 
        Ellington in New York.

    <p>In 1989, a bronze plaque was attached to the newly named 
        Duke Ellington Building at 2121 Ward Place NW. In 
        2012, the new owner of the building commissioned a mural 
        by Aniekan Udofia that appears above the lettering "Duke
        Ellington". In 2010 the triangular park, across the street from 
        Duke Ellington's birth site, at the intersection of New Hampshire 
        and M Streets NW, was named the Duke Ellington Park.
        Ellington's residence at 2728 Sherman Avenue NW, during the 
        years 1919–1922, is marked by a bronze plaque.
        On February 24, 2009, the United States Mint issued a coin 
        with Duke Ellington on it, making him the first African 
        American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin.
         Ellington appears on the reverse (tails) side of the District of 
        Columbia quarter.The coin is part of the U.S. Mint's 
        program honoring the District and the U.S. territories and 
        celebrates Ellington's birthplace in the District of Columbia. 
        Ellington is depicted on the quarter seated at a piano, sheet 
        music in hand, along with the inscription "Justice for All", 
        which is the District's motto.
        In 1986, a United States commemorative stamp was issued 
        featuring Ellington's likeness.</p>
